# uBMS
A tiny BMS to plug into things

I used this to plug into my uVU board, but it coulld be used for other things. A regular micro-B USB plugs in and charges it, and the little BMS chip and a boost supply do the rest for the 5V output.

I didn't get too long of a battery life from this into the uVU, but that isn't designed to be ultra low power anyways.
